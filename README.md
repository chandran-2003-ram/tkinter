# tkinter
##### This repo is for developing my tkinter knowledge in basic applications and uploading it into github for future use and side by learning how to use github.<br />
### 1. basic calculator app :
 #### Still now completed with operations like:
* addition 
* subtraction
* multiplication
* division
* square
* squareroot
* 1 divided by x

 Yet to do more by adding many features and to makesure a better calculating app with a good GUI.

### 2. A random number generating app with GUI 
* Achieved yet : 
 * Graphical user interface
 *  Used try except block to rectify the empty guess ValueError
* Goal : Graphical user interface app with selecting range by the user itself

 ##### Errors : 1. User cannot give the range they wanted 2. Last turn cannot be seen which the user need to make it in there own memory for it.
